A platform jumping game written in C using SDL library.

## Why

This is mainly a playground in which I experiment with some basic SDL stuff and
because I haven't coded in C for years, so I wanted to refresh myself and have
something to do.

## How

You need SDL2 (along with image, mixer and ttf) to be able to compile. If you
don't already have it, install using a package manager of your choice.

On Mac OS X (using homebrew):

    $ brew install sdl2 sdl2_image sdl2_mixer sdl2_ttf

On any Debian-based Linux (using apt-get):

    $ sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev 

Compile using make:

    $ make

Run:

    $ make run
